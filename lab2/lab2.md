This lab contains the realization of the following methods:
1. `Gradient Descent:`   
applied on Logistic Regression and multivariate regression     
2. `Decision Tree amd Random Forest:`    
using visualization tools to get a direct sense of this method.     
3. `K nearest neighbors:`   
Compare the differences with different k values     
4. `Bagging and Boosting:`   
which are two aggregating methods, also known as ensemble methods. I changed the number of base estimator to make comparisons.
