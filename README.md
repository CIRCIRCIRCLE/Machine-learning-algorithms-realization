# Machine-learning-algorithms-realization

This respository contains the mathmetical realization of basic machine learning algorithms.  The content is based on the ELEC0134 Applied Machine Learning Systems.

## Lab1:   
Linear Regression: mutivariate and singevariate  
Cross validation  
Ridge-Regression  

## Lab2:
`Gradient Descent:`  
applied on Logistic Regression and multivariate regression
`Decision Tree amd Random Forest:`
using visualization tools to get a direct sense of this method.
`K nearest neighbors:`
Compare the differences with different k values
`Bagging and Boosting:`
which are two aggregating methods, also known as ensemble methods. I changed the number of base estimator to make comparisons.
